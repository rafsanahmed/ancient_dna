# This folder contains the initial dataset obtained

includes four datasets of ancient DNA samples. Each dataset consists of sample ID, the country where this sample was found, eight temporal admixture components (that sum to 1 in each individual), and the real age of the samples (measured in BP = years before the present). Together, the eight temporal components are correlated with the age of the sample.
